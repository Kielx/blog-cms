# Kielx's blog.

## Overview:

The goal is to at first create a simple blog, in which I will be able to write what I learned.
I hope that I will be able to keep myself accountable for learning progress and to help me organize my thoughts.
To keep myself on track, for the first time I create a plan.

## Goal:

Fully functional blog, with posts kept in database. Ability to add and remove posts.

## Plan:

- [x] ~~Create a basic Node.js server which will host the whole application.~~ _Done on 21.07.2020_
- [x] ~~Start writing about stuff you learned / did to get in habit and practice writing.~~ _Created my first blog post on 21.07.2020!_
- [ ] Set up routes for pages.
- [ ] Create a template with template engine (Pug?).
- [ ] Make it possible to add / delete posts.
- [ ] Find a place and a way to deploy your blog somewhere.
- [ ] More...
