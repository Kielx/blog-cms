# Kielx's blog.

## Overview:

The goal is to at first create a simple blog, in which I will be able to write what I learned.
I hope that I will be able to keep myself accountable for learning progress and to help me organize my thoughts.
To keep myself on track, for the first time I create a plan.

## Goal:

Fully functional blog, with posts kept in database. Ability to add and remove posts.

## Plan:

- [x] ~~Create a basic Node.js server which will host the whole application.~~ **(Done on 21.07.2020)**
- [x] ~~Start writing about stuff you learned / did to get in habit and practice writing.~~ **(Created my first blog post on 21.07.2020!)**
- [ ] Set up routes for pages.
- [x] Create a template with template engine (Pug?). **(_Working on_)**
  - ~~Create basic template~~
  - Create route that will work for dynamic posts
  - Maybe add some styling
  - ~~Decide how to deal with names and links to posts~~ **22.07.2020**
- [ ] Make it possible to add / delete posts.
