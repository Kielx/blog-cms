Today I started the project and created the skeleton of it. I learned about markdown language and finally learned what .md extension means. I refreshed the memory of how the basic node express server is structured, while also refreshing to structure of json files. I also managed to create posts template in json file, index view/template of blog post page, got few ideas about how to structure the further project. Mainly to get a request for blog name or number, and pipe that req param to view engine. Also I wrote my first blog post. Finally!
