Today I started the project and created the skeleton of it. I learned about markdown language and finally learned what .md extension means. I refreshed the memory of how the basic node express server is structured, while also refreshing to structure of json files. I also managed to create posts template in json file, index view/template of blog post page, got few ideas about how to structure the further project. Mainly to get a request for blog name or number, and pipe that req param to view engine. Also I wrote my first blog post. Finally!

Spent a lot of time figuring out how to deal with pug templating. Also had to find a way to deal with names for posts, acessing posts and routing to them. Got a basic idea and a working solution set up.

Today after work and all necessarry errands that I had to do I was really tired. I could'nt force myself to do any productive work. Got to bed early to get some sleep. Before that I had an AHA! moment when I finally got my mind wrapped around how does view template and router work in express. Seems like I dont really need a router for my project, at least now. Got my mind on finishing the template.

Woke up earlier because my daughter got an serious allergic reaction. Quick visit at the emergency and we got sent off. Doctor google'd the allegry and said that we should give her all the same medicine that we were giving her. Well...
Since I got earlier I had a chance to spend 25 minutes of work on project before going to my job. Found out in express documentation that I can pass an array of paths and therefore don't need a router. At least for now. Later on I plan to rework the templates for post and index.
